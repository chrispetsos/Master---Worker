# Master-Worker
Dissertation for my MSc Software Engineering in Sunderland, UK, 2004.

### Abstract
The rapid evolution of computer science has led to applications that are high-demanding in computer resources. Different organisations can share distributed resources in a collaborative manner in order to form Computational Grids. A lot of effort is being paid world-wide for a common grid infrastructure to be adopted by all countries. Greece is participating actively in this movement and projects are already on track for the establishment of a national greek grid. The purpose of this project is to build a grid enabled prototype system that will distribute highly intensive in computing power applications to many computers. The programming language that is used is Java. A lot of architectures and frameworks exist that can be used for the design and implementation of this system. The architecture that was deemed more appropriate was the Master-Worker design pattern and the framework that was used was Jini in conjunction with the JavaSpaces service that it provides. The system was designed under the light of software engineering design principles and patterns in order to be easily extensible, scalable and efficient. A third party raytracing engine was used for the evaluation of the system.
